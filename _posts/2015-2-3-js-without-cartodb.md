# Can Torque be used without uploading the data to CartoDB? #

A third option for using Torque, which we will explore today, is to use the library in conjunction 
with two other CartoDB JavaScript libraries to connect to data that is not uploaded to a CartoDB 
account, but is rather in our own PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database.

This presentation walks through setting up a stand-alone Torque animation.
