# How is Torque JS designed to be used? #

The Torque JavaScript library can also be used to define a Torque map layer that can be added to
a Leaflet or Google Maps base layer.  The layer is defined with the user name and public table of a 
CartoDB account to use, and some special CartoCSS that defines aspects of the animation.

Here's an [example](http://cartodb.github.io/torque/examples/navy_leaflet) from the Torque project GitHub Pages.
